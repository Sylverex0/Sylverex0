## About Me

I'm a backend developer with a passion for using C# to build high-performance applications. I specialize in working with async, requests, and concurrency to deliver efficient, scalable solutions. While I'm not a fan of GUI or frontend development, I love working on the backend and building systems that are reliable, robust, and feature-rich.
